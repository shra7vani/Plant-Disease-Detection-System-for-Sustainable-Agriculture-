# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection Using CNN

## 📝 Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model capable of detecting and classifying plant diseases from leaf images. The model identifies the type of disease affecting a plant based on visible symptoms in leaf images.
